  Can you believe how crazy airfare is right now? Even with crude oil at $45/bbl. flights and their prices are still sky high. When transportation has become one of the most crucial aspects of our lives in the 21st Century, there’s no shortage of demand to fly. The conglomerates don’t loosen one knot on their monopolies. I probably sound like an old man, but holy cow is travelling expensive.

Since I was born, I have always been an avid traveller, though not for the intents you might think. As a chess player, I was able to go to a ton of places from BC to Ontario to Brazil to even Turkey! In fact, by the time I was 15 I had gone to 5 continents and almost 20 countries. While this isn’t extraordinary, it was for me — someone who actually detested travelling.

I mean, why would I spend money and go out of my comfortable home to who knows where, when I could be using that time to get to Level 70 on Maplestory? The only thing I’d look forward to while travelling is the flight back home. And boy, you have no idea how much I missed out on just because of that mentality.

Of course, just being able to **be** outside of your home will give you new perspectives, whether you like it or not. Even though I wasn’t particularly fond of it, travelling had an indelible impact on shaping my worldview. Every new place, culture, language, or person that I made contact with gave me new puzzle pieces to picture the world.

As I started to grow up and become more aware of my goals, I realized that travelling had anything and everything to do with them. The seed that was planted inside of me had began to sprout — it began to develop as what most people would call a “passion”.

**Passion** **is the why**.

Out of the stack of plans I have this year, travelling around Asia was one of the most important. It wasn’t about taking a vacation or filling my Instagram with me squatted down, holding a peace sign pose in front of The Great Wall of China, it was about having a chance to immerse myself in a completely different culture and live my life in a completely different way. It was about *building my vision. *I believe in order to truly reap the rewards of travelling, you have to face it genuinely. Sure, being a tourist is fun, but you are spending most of your time on some overpriced activity that is shaped for and marketed towards foreigners; you only get to see a show — not the **real** culture and intricacies behind the stage.

When you find a reason for your passion, you need to be able to put it into action. Organizing a plan and scheduling an itinerary is a lot more trouble than it looks. You have to research everything, apply for visas, book flights, find accommodation, plan days, and deal with a ton of logistics that will cause you to lose time, patience, and hair. If you want to take a 1 week vacation to a resort in Mexico, well I suppose that’s not a task for a hero, but if you want to seriously plan out a meaningful adventure, you bet your ass you’re going to need to work for it. You’re going to have to have some “drive”.

**Drive is the how.**

In order to accomplish anything, you need a good attitude and a proper execution. And in order to execute anything, you need drive. Will power. Strength. Courage. Whatever you want to call it, it is a crucial ingredient. Drive is what bridges your passion to the edge of reality; it is how things are done. The ability to go from **thinking** about your passion to taking initiative and **doing **is what drive is responsible for. You cannot do one without the other.

If not activated, drive is extremely difficult to maintain. It’s like a muscle that needs to be exercised every day in order to have the strength to be able to do things. I know this first hand because I thought about this trip 5 months ago, and am only beginning to book it now…

Even so, with the initiative that I’m taking and the steadfast attitude that I have towards this travelling, things do not get easier. There are a million of Airlines to choose from and another million of websites to search from. On top of that, I need to decide which cities and places I want to go to, and what I want to do in them. I need to know what the methods of transportation and communication are, and find out what’s best for my purposes. And of course, my purposes are always changing, meaning my research and planning is always changing — and my brain is now not working.

Sure you might have the passion. And if you’re lucky, you might be a strong-willed, conviction-filled candidate suited for the job. But these two attributes are absolutely useless if you don’t know where the interview is. The most important ingredient — the one that rules them all is “direction”.

**Direction is the everything else.**

Direction is not just a part of the why and the do, it is the who, what, when, where, why, what, how, pow, wow, chow — ok I’m getting a little carried away. When I say direction is everything, I mean it is **everything.**

Without direction, your passion and drive are like lost cats and dogs in the middle of the Mediterranean. Yeah, good luck. In order to get those guys to Japan, I need to show them where it is, how to get there, how to angle their sails, and what to look for. Direction encompasses everything because it is the brains of the trifecta. If I want my trip to truly be a success, I need to organize a successful plan, and to do that, I need direction.

Direction is abstract. It’s not the same for everyone. And I’m not saying that everyone’s direction is the same, because that’s just a blatant truth, but even everyone’s definition of direction is different. It isn’t just a simple Never Eat Soggy Worms convention, it is the vision behind everything that we do. Without direction, we are just soggy worms squirming around on the pavement; it doesn’t matter how much passion or drive we have, we are going nowhere!

While these three ingredients are absolutely core to cooking a nice trip to Asia, they are three principles that are imperative to our lives. In the grandiose theme of things, everyone wants to achieve something. Unfortunately, many of us, preoccupied with the busy busy things in life, ironically do not get much time to think about life itself. Many of us don’t even know what we want to achieve, or what we want to do in life. Sure, you could say “I want to be happy”, or “I want to be successful”, but without opening your eyes and building your vision, you will end up stagnating on the pavement.

I’ve wondered many times as a kid why I couldn’t put my foot down on something and gone with it. I had the passion. I had the drive. But I was always squirming. I didn’t know what I liked and I didn’t know what there was to like. I never went out of my zone to see the world and look at the paths that could get me to where I wanted to be. In fact, I didn’t even know where I wanted to be. I just never tried to look anywhere other than at my feet. I never tried to consciously build my vision, and I was never able to find any slightest hint of direction.

But by starting to exercise my drive and charge it with my passion, I have been able to boost outside of my own bubble. By consciously trying to gain new perspectives and experiences to heighten myself, I’ve been able to see a greater view. To find direction, I realized that I need to stop wasting time thinking so much and squandering in my own comfort. The more time passes, the weaker my drive gets and the less energized my passion becomes. The real trick was to simply get out and **DO**. Of course, it’s a process, but by simply opening my eyes and looking, I have began to see a very thin, but very real, line of direction.

Self-improvement, building relationships, working towards goals, living life — at the ground level, they all share these three ingredients as fundamental leptons to their success.

If my 13 year old self were to ask the same question today, “What’s the point of travelling?”

I’d think about passion, drive, and direction, and then I’d tell him to shut up and do it.
