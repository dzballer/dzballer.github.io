  In grade 5, I used to bring a water bottle every day to school. Usually, I’d just fill it up with water from the fountain, but on this one day, I filled it up with some chocolate milk from home. I’d been in the habit of just using it with water, so I wasn’t really used to cleaning it — that was a mistake.

I ended up leaving it in my desk for 2 weeks, and only found it in the depths of the mess because there was a hint of a weird scent. Since it was sealed away in the bottle, I wasn’t paying attention to the smell, but inside the bottle was a swamp of coagulated chocolate turds, coated by a very visible layer of mold. The colours had sat so long in the cauldron that I could not even tell what was or had been in there.

One of my friends had seen the bottle and could not even comprehend what I was holding in my hands. To him, it probably looked like an experiment conducted by mixing jello, poop, and cooties together.

It was the grossest thing I had ever seen. I couldn’t imagine how it smelled.

Luckily for me, I never had to. My friend cleaned the entire thing.

Earlier that month, that same friend saw a cool blue mechanical pencil I had, and said he wanted to buy it for 5 bucks. Of course, I’m Chinese so no deal goes down without some hardballing.

The offer upped to 15.

I’ve seen some Obama-tier pens, but 15 bucks for a blue mechanical pencil? If I could sell pencils for 15 bucks in 2015, I’d make Bill Gates my son. But for *some* reason, I just couldn’t let it go.

Coincidentally, that’s when I found my water bottle.

“You promise that you’ll sell me the pencil after this.”

“If it’s spot clean.”

“Okay, promise?”

“I promise.”

So with the bottle in hand, the gallant knight rode his horse down the hallway and into the washroom. A few minutes later, a scrawny boy appeared at the door. His eyes were bloodshot, skin was blank white, and the soul had been sucked out of his face — you could barely recognize him. Like a warrior defeated in battle, he had only scraped back half alive. As he was crawling towards me, tears dripping down his chin, snot hanging from his lip, he began to raise his hand as if he had brought back a souvenir of war. It was the bottle.

I burst out in a rampage of laughter. I couldn’t contain myself. The entire class was looking at me; I was laughing so hard, people from the class beside us started laughing too. Even as I write this, I can’t resist smiling.

“Dude, It smelled like…” He inched closer to my ear so that the teacher couldn’t hear, “like *ass.*”

I never ended up selling that pencil to him. I broke my promise and made him go through the worst experience of his life. I felt bad. I mean, he probably lost 2 years. But for *some* reason, I just couldn’t sell it.

Looking back in hindsight, it was stupid to go back on my word and even stupider for not accepting $15 for a pencil. I would have changed my mind but ironically, I ended up losing it anyways.

*Why didn’t you just sell the pencil? What reason did you have for not making a 1500% profit?*

That’s a good question. And that’s the entire point of this post.

When I was a kid, my parents were extremely strict about money. I could not buy anything that wasn’t a necessity, and even things like Yu-gi-oh cards and Beyblades were once in a year Christmas presents. Up to grade 3, I would get a toonie each year for my birthday. My entire upbringing focused on the value of money, and because of it, I was always conscious about spending it. Since I didn’t have much money, I would never want to use it.

At the same time, by learning the value of money, I began to learn how to care for things in general. I would treasure my few possessions and treat my friends and stuffed animals like family. Anything that I owned was dear to me — it held ineffable value.

So when I rejected the $15 offer, it was because, as funny as it sounds, I truly cared about the pencil. Just having been one of my possessions, it was something that had more than just sentimental value to me. It was *a part* of me. As someone who didn’t own much, everything that I had was a part of me. The pencil was no exception.

I remember very clearly the thoughts that went through my head when I was debating whether or not to sell it. It’s not like I was steadfast in my decision; I cared about money, and to someone like me, $15 was a mouthwatering sum, but in my thoughts, I couldn’t justify selling a piece of me for something so *consumable*.

I said to myself, “$15 is the price of two Subway Footlongs, but after I eat them, they’ll just disappear. No matter how much I use this pencil, it will always be here.”

*Fair enough,* you might say, *why not accept the $15 and buy the exact same pencil for a fraction of what you’ve earned?*

Of course, I considered it. I was relatively money aware and would’ve jumped at any chance to make it, but at that moment, that pencil and that pencil alone was what mattered to me. Like a diary, a pet, or a friend, it wasn’t something replaceable. It held a spot in my heart, and if I let it go, another pencil would not have been able to fill that void.

To me, it was more important than money. There are many more important things than money.

When I talk to anybody, in almost any conversation, I always hear a variation of** “Omg! I would love to do [x]. Honestly! But I just don’t have the money.”**

Don’t get me wrong, I perfectly understand circumstance. Not everyone can do everything, and we all live in different situations that give us the privilege to do different things, but the phrase, “I don’t have enough money,” has began to be spoken more often as an **excuse** than as a **reason**.

Of course, not being able to afford something is one thing, but having the money and not using it another. At the same time, making unnecessary or stupid purchases commonly results in the aforementioned. This isn’t an argument between minimalism and materialism. It is an argument against both.

Just yesterday, my mom found out that our family’s 10 year collection 200, 000 Aeroplan points (~ $1400) expired. We had never used any of it because we were always saving it. Waiting for the right time, saving it for the right trip — it just doesn’t work.

In our lifetimes, there are so many things that we can do. In the infinite space of the universe, there are so many opportunities and experiences that exist. However, because of many peoples’ unwillingness to use their money, or the reckless spending that renders them unable to pay for the important things, they miss out on the most valuable things in life. Granted, there is a balance between frugality and wastefulness, but many of us are on the sides of the spectrum. In a generation where it’s easy to indulge in food, tech, and materialistic objects, we hesitate to spend on things like travelling, education, and experiences because of the cost.

I never liked buying food when I was young, because I would view food as something consumable. Once you eat it, it’s gone. And similarly, many people have the same beliefs regarding experiences. Once you do it, it’s done.

It got to the point where I’d starve myself so that I wouldn’t have to spend money on food. You might think that’s stupid, but isn’t that what a lot of people are doing with their lives? We garner so much value in money that the more focus we put into it, the less attention we pay to our lives. You see, what many people don’t realize is that while the currency of the world is money, the currency of the universe is not.

It’s **time.**

Time can buy love, it can buy friends, hell, it can even buy money. Time is the fundamental resource of what you and I are made of. Time is the most expensive, most important, and most precious material that anyone could have. We just don’t see it. And the longer we hold onto secondary material like money, the more time passes.

If you don’t pay attention to him, the god of time won’t bat you an eye.

The less care you have for time, the less care it will have for you. The more we reject opportunities in our life, the more we reject ourselves. What’s the point of holding on to a bank of money if our bank of time is draining by the second? When we are able to go out and see the world, we gain perspectives and experiences that become a part of us. While it may seem that it is consumable, these experiences stick with us for the rest of our lives. Just because it isn’t something tangible doesn’t mean it isn’t valuable.

Time and time again, we hold onto our money because we believe that one day we’ll find a reason to spend it. Maybe that one day will come, but maybe it won’t. And when it doesn’t, you will have spent a lifetime of holding onto not value, but pieces of paper and metal. By using money as an excuse, we limit the beautiful things in life that time can buy.

Believe me, I used to be one of the top 10 frugalest dudes in the country. I had thought money was everything. When people dropped the overused, *“Can money buy happiness?”* I’d always reply with, “Yes! Money can buy everything! Money can buy my soul! Money can buy my dad!” But life has told me otherwise.

For what we believe is important, for which we are afraid to spend money, and for why we live our lives, we cannot continue to restrict ourselves from the wonder that the stars has to offer. It’s time to open our eyes. It’s time to stop letting the fear of spending money prevent us from spending our time. It’s time to get out in the world, do the things we want to do and live the life we want to live. If you are saving your money, save it for something **meaningful**, and when you have enough, **spend it**. It tends to be a common pattern where when we save up so much money, we want to save even more. When we hit a new bar, we want to go even higher, but the higher up the mountain, the colder it gets.

Wonder why sometimes when we indulge in materialistic possessions or unimportant purchases, we don’t feel good about them? Like we feel our money and our time are wasted? That’s because **they are**. That’s because when our bank balance falls from one number to another, the energy that’s given off is dissipated into entropy; it’s given to the things that don’t care about us. But when we spend on important things like our friends, our family, our curiosity, and our passions, the energy is given off as meaning. Meaning in the form of inspiration, happiness, love, or life itself.

We only have so many seconds in each of our lifetimes, why let them pass without doing what we want to do because of some kind of man made limit? Not everything requires money, but if it does, don’t let it stop you. For the important things in life, spend money like it’s wildfire. Spend all the money in the world so that it never prevents you from not living a single experience you want to live.

By itself, can money really buy happiness? This question is asked so much that I don’t even think the answer matters anymore. It has no relevance because we know one thing for certain.

**Time can buy everything.**

So let’s spend it wisely.
