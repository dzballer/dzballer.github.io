  Today is Day 33, August 23rd, 2019. The retreat is long since finished, but a key takeaway is the importance of continuity. Even post-retreat, maintaining practice is like maintaining a muscle. Train and utilize, or atrophy. Train in proper meditation sessions, and utilize in the day-to-day. Walking to work, listening to music, sleeping — continuity of awareness is key.

I’m writing from the balcony of an AirBnB in the Western coast of Sicily. The clock shows 11:41PM and the moon is three quarters bright with a strange red hue. It’s sitting just centimetres above the ocean. Maybe not centimetres, I don’t know. I’ve had a few glasses of wine and should probably head to sleep soon. Dinner was Ravioli di Provolone al Ragu (AKA cheese dumplings — made by yours truly), paired with pink clouds in the sky and “Ruthless” by The Marías.

I haven’t been meditating much recently. It’s hard to focus in the Italian heat, and I’ve been moving cities often, more than I’d like to.

Sometimes when I’m on a train through the countryside, or when I’m sitting outside a little espresso cafe, the thought comes to me: maybe now’s a good time to practice.

A little more clarity and mindfulness ought to pair well with travel, wouldn’t it? The cleaner the mind, the clearer the experience. But when things get busy, it’s just hard to justify. Time spent on meditation is time that could be spent on other things, like seeing the city, or work, or sleep. Simply put, it’s easier to do things when the payoff is more tangible.

Right when the retreat ended, though, I did keep up some kind of daily practice. Two hours a day, the teacher suggested. Two hours — an absurd idea if I’d heard it without context. But having gone through the 10 days, trying it afterwards wasn’t out of the question. In fact, at the time two hours didn’t feel unnatural; in some sense, even palpably rewarding. The drive home after the retreat, my first cup of coffee coming back, listening to music — they were experiences in of themselves. The ordinary had become much more interesting, more *full*. As if I was seeing a new side of things that I didn’t before; or just didn’t notice, for that matter.

It made me wonder, what exactly is different than before? How *fully* are you supposed to, or even capable of experiencing?

In any case, looking back, when the mind itself was subtler, perhaps the subtler payoffs became more clear as well. A pebble sees more obvious to an ant than to an elephant, after all.

Since then, 3 weeks have passed. Some of the initial sensitivity has lulled, and some of the post-retreat feelings that I felt have settled back into their original seats. Whether those feelings were from the meditation itself, or just from 10 days of asceticism, I don’t really know yet. But in one way or another, *something* has persisted.

Sometimes I just catch myself noticing things more. A dim spherical lantern in the corner of the balcony. The subtle smell of residual heat on the concrete from the afternoon sun. The sound of waves in the distance, or how my elbows feel on the table — these sorts of little things. I feel like I’m more here than I used to be.

Maybe muscle doesn’t atrophy as quickly as I think. Or maybe it’s just the Sicily effect. “I Like It” by DeBarge is playing on my bluetooth speaker.

The moon has gotten a few inches higher since a few minutes ago. It’s still as red as before, and now there’s a long red shadow reflecting off the ocean, like an ellipses trailing from the horizon. It’s weird to see the moon in this colour. I try to take a picture with my phone, but it doesn’t really get anything, except for a blurry red dot in the distance.

In the 2 weeks that I’ve been traveling around Italy, I haven’t gone by any particular schedule or intent. In the mornings, I wake up, grab a light breakfast and espresso, and head to the supermarket. I find the deli, take a number, and wait for the Italian guy to call on me. I don’t actually know all the numbers in Italian yet, but when my turn comes, I manage to figure it out (someone tells me).

I look at the wall of meats (there’s literally a wall of meats), point at one of the big prosciutto thighs, and say *200 grams please*. It might not sound like much, but 200 grams of prosciutto is a lot of salt, and a lot of fat — often a realization only made post-consumption. Anyhow, the butcher eyeballs the number of slices, and somehow always gets it right. He wraps the meat in a plastic sheet, in the same way someone folds a brochure, looks up at me and asks, *buoi (Is that all)?* *No*, I say. *Can I get 200 grams of salami too?*

The rest of the morning is spent trying to work, though I question how much work is actually getting done. No matter, in the afternoons I still reward myself with a little walk around the neighbourhood.

Italians take a siesta at midday, so by the time I get out of the house, everyone else has gone back in. Shops are closed, and streets are empty but with an overflow of sunlight and dry cries of cicadas. Sometimes a wandering old lady will pass by, smile and say, “Ciao”. Ciao, I say, and continue on with my walk.

The people are friendly here in the countryside (much more than compared to big cities, like Florence, per say), and the ambience is laid-back. In the evening, I’ll find a cheap pasta trattoria, have a glass of wine, and walk around for another short while before heading to bed.

Every 3 or 4 days, I look for a different city, and book another 3 or 4 day stay. I jam my stuff in my small backpack and duffel, and ride the train to my next stop.

This sounds all fine, I know. I’m free and relaxed and am bouncing my way across the Italian boot, one day in San Gimignano, one day in Fontanella, prosciutto and espresso every morning, pasta every night. There is nothing to complain about, no real problems to worry about. Certainly a very privileged, luxurious way to be living.

Yet sometimes, in some kind of incomprehensible fashion, I will get a strange feeling that something isn’t right. Like an invisible itch somewhere below my skin.

I don’t really know what it is, or why it’s there. On some days, during my midday walks, the feeling will come to me suddenly and unexpectedly, like an old lady popping out from an alleyway. But instead of smiling and greeting me, she’ll just follow me around, looking at me with neutral eyes that seem to hold no meaning whatsoever. I run and she runs. I stop and she stops.

What do you want? I want to turn around and ask. But that seems kind of rude, and she doesn’t look like she’ll give me a response anyways. Instead, I’ll turn to face her, flash as friendly of a smile as I can make, and say, “Ciao!” Unamused, she continues staring right at me, as if my voice had skipped past the curves of her ears.

Sometimes I’ll try to rationalize this feeling. Be logical and objective, and things might become clear. Maybe I’m just not getting enough work done. I’ve set some deadlines for myself that I’m probably not going to make, so perhaps this feeling is from the uncomfortable distance between where I am, and where I want to be. And I guess, constantly moving from place to place is only distracting me, and magnifying this. That makes sense.

When I can properly bring these thoughts to a close, I’ll turn around and realize, the old lady’s gone. Thank goodness, I say to myself. That was really weird and uncomfortable. The rest of the walk feels nice and light, as if I’ve taken a jam-packed backpack off my shoulders, and set it freely on the side of the road.

<figcaption class="caption">somewhere in tuscany</figcaption>
But the next day, she’s there again, in the middle of the street looking right at me. Why? I’ve already taken care of your business, so what do you want this time? Seeing her for the second time almost makes me angry. In fact, I hate that empty neutral look of hers. If you’re going to do this, surely you can give me something to work with. Something like a sign or hint. Even a smile or frown would do, just not this strange gaze that I can’t even properly describe, let alone interpret, boring holes through my chest. Can’t you be a little less abstract?

There’s never any response. I just continue walking, and she continues following. Her stare weighing heavier every step of the way.

At a certain point, having run out of ideas, I give up and find a little bench beside a park. The sun is smouldering the skin on my shoulders, and it makes me wonder if I put enough sunscreen. Cicadas continue to fill the air, passing messages through the trees.

The old lady is sitting right beside me, looking at me in the same way she always does. This time, I have nothing to do but to look back. Her expression doesn’t change. Maybe she doesn’t even notice me looking at her.

There’s nothing particular about this old lady. I wouldn’t say she looks youthful, but it’s not like she’s decrepit either. She looks like as much of an old lady as old ladies can get. Gray hair, lips, an exceptionally average nose, and two old-lady looking like eyes. If I flipped through an encyclopedia to the “Old Lady” entry, I could expect her picture to be right there, down to the finest detail, looking at me in the very same way.

Sometimes, I’ll glance about different parts of her face. A few wrinkles here and there, in the creases of her eyes, behind her cheekbones. Nothing to be worried about. Make sure to put enough sunscreen, I want to say. But I’m not sure if those words would reach her.

Sometimes I’ll get really close, and stare straight into her eyes, trying to find a glint of emotion or reflection of what she’s looking at, but never to any avail. Instead, I’ll notice weird details, like how the shape of her irises aren’t perfectly circular. Or that the little strands of colour in them seem to all be slightly different shades. I don’t really care about these things, but look long enough, they just appear themselves.

As always, she just continues to look in my direction, with the same discomforting, expressionless expression.

<figcaption class="caption">somewhere in tuscany</figcaption>
After a while, I get up from the bench, stretch my arms in the air, and walk back towards my AirBnB. The old lady gets up without a word and silently follows my pace.

Weirdly enough, though, having sat down with her, I don’t mind her presence as much. Maybe it feels like I’ve gotten to know her a little bit better. More than I did before at least. Don’t get me wrong, this arrangement is still a little uncomfortable, but she’s not as strange and threatening as she felt before. I mean, how could she be — after a good proper look, she’s just an average old lady (if not the most average old lady in the world).

We just keep walking in this way, me in front, her behind, quietly through the dry streets of the countryside.

At a certain point, I notice her footsteps getting quieter and quieter. Are we walking too fast? I turn around to see if something’s happened. And there she is, back facing me, walking away down the street by herself.

What a strange old lady, I think to myself, and head back to my AirBnB to do some afternoon work.

<figcaption class="caption">florence</figcaption>
The waves in the distance have gotten louder than before. A few empty plates sit on the table, left with streaks of sauce from dinner. The bottle of wine is still quarter full, but I think I’ll just have some water before I head to sleep.

Aside the physical senses, recently I’ve began to notice other things too. I don’t mean to brag, but in the middle of thinking a certain thought, or feeling a certain way, a light realization often comes to me: I am indeed thinking, or feeling, that way.

Not the most tremendous discovery, I suppose, but it’s something I haven’t noticed before. The thoughts or feelings don’t stop; they still continue, like dancers in a play. Just, every now and then, some kind of overlay suddenly pops up. A progress bar hovers on the bottom, and perhaps a title displays too, as if someone accidentally moved the mouse during a video. Sometimes it’s a flicker, just the length of a frame. Sometimes it feels like I’m here for a while. But when it happens, the scene seems to separate; I’ve been taken out of immersion, and zoomed out into third-person, the background set. The scene is there, and I am here.

And watching in this way, those thoughts or feelings seem a little different, as if they have lost the feeling of characters in a story, and become actors on a screen. Just shapes and lines, moving and contouring, folding and unfolding, by themselves.

Reactions in certain situations, or changes in emotions — sometimes they feel similar. Separate, and just there. And in some sense, not so different from the physical sensations on the skin either. Little shapes scattered around the dish. Different in size, colour, and movement, but shapes nonetheless.

![](/img/1*x8woT-9kyr59QgJkQvmP9g.jpeg){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">serra di rapolano</figcaption>
Stare long enough, I often find a piece of white gunk on the dish, rubbery and translucent. It’s hard to tell, especially when looking from the inside. The gunk is glued on so tight, and sometimes so deceptively. As if it were part of another shape; an edge, or a corner. It may have even seemed like a shape itself.

But from this zoomed-out angle, it’s easier to make out the borders of different shapes, thoughts and feelings. With a proper look, the gunk turns out to be just a piece of fat. Why would someone put this here? As if alive, it squirms around, in no particular kind of pattern. Perhaps it just feels uncomfortable being watched. I can understand; after all, being watched is never a pleasant feeling. Sometimes it feels like whoever is watching you is trying to strip you down, to see what you look like, and what you really look like.

Or maybe it’s just always like this. I don’t know. Without any warning, the piece of fat eventually just disappears, as if dissolving into nothing, revealing whatever was behind it. Something has happened, but nothing feels significantly different. Only that the shape of the feeling or thought, has lost some size, and perhaps seems a bit smaller than before.

But in a cascading fashion, more of it begins to appear. Either it’s coming to the surface from somewhere, or I am just now realizing that what was previously shape, is actually fat again. In fact, where the initial piece dissolved, I can see more and more underneath.

What exactly the fat is doing there, I’m not sure. I guess in some way, it pads shapes to make them seem bigger, or covers shapes to make them seem smaller. How it came about, or where it went, is a mystery to me. But in any case, something extra, that adds or detracts from the original.

In that sense, perhaps it acts as some kind of modifier, adjective. To feelings, exaggerated or diminished. To thoughts, overblown or understated. Some way in a similar effect of habits and biases. Frameworks and systems. Processes. Anxieties, dissonance, depression. Thinking or emotional patterns, both conscious and unconscious. Dim tinted lights in the back of my head. What I’m used to, what I’m scared of. Things I think I taste, but shouldn’t be. Things I’m not tasting, but could be.

And if I look long enough, sometimes it becomes easier to make out subtler details. The edges become more defined, and the boundaries of what is shape, what is extraneous fat, become clearer and clearer.

Perhaps meditation has helped me in this way: I have begun to see my own fat better.

<figcaption class="caption">serra di rapolano</figcaption>
Beyond all the metaphors used to understand it, Vipassana is perhaps, some kind of metaphor in itself. Not to illustrate a scene, or explain a concept, but one of direct experience. Experiencing it, in turn experiencing whatever it refers to.

Where any thing, physical or nonphysical, can be directly experienced as if a sensation on the skin — tangibly, on a petri dish, in front of the microscope — j*ust feel*. Sharpened and subtle enough, the awareness cuts through the deepest layers of fat. Until every edge of sensation trimmed to its bare form, can be felt easily, and more importantly, in absolute totality.

And while the practical sides of meditation are the quickest to recognize, I guess by transitivity, I can start to make more sense of the fundamental sides as well. *Truth, and insight*. To see something as it is, from every angle, to the subtlest detail, all at once, is in a sense, truth. And ultimately perhaps, what Vipassana is getting at.

Of course, there are always epistemological potholes everywhere, and any discourse on truth, liberation, happiness, enlightenment etc. is never a smooth ride. Signs are everywhere with crafted philosophical ideas and theoretical lyrics. People yell at you and flip out massive dongs in the name of syllogism and science. It is intimidating, and always very distracting. Sometimes they do make sense and help cut through fat. Sometimes they themselves, are just fat.

And sometimes that type of fat is the hardest to get rid of, the type that pretends to be muscle. It clouds vision, weighs heavy, and creates a false sense of strength. It’s interesting and fun, and sometimes very useful to intellectualize; but actually driving on the road, even if just a little bit, is an entirely different game.

![](/img/1*Pzkg3-j6hjFyp6KJ6NGy2A.jpeg){: class="bigger-image" }
<figcaption class="caption">trapani</figcaption>
So I guess, there’s not much to think about. It’s not a thinking game after all. Rather, just an act of practice, the same as riding a bicycle, or learning to drive — something you can directly feel and operate. Building muscle memory, strength, discipline, focus, balance, and equanimity. Sharpening a craft.

The moon has just passed its apex in the sky, and according to my computer’s clock, it is now technically Day 34. The sound of waves fades in from the distance. Location Unknown by HONNE is playing from my laptop speakers.

Vipassana was a good test run, but the onus of continuity still remains. Writing this too, is only just another way of intellectualizing things. My thoughts, my feelings, and my dong(s) is out on the paper. And it would be a shame to just leave it there, not seeing it through. If I genuinely believe something, I should act on it.

In other words, practice before bed, perhaps, is what I am trying to tell myself. I’ve said that for a few days now.

Still, truth be told, I don’t know if I will. Right now, at least. The Italian heat has been exhausting, and I’ve had a bit more wine than I should have. Someone once told me to try and “write drunk, edit sober.” I can see its merits, but I’m not sure meditation works in the same way. Though if I sit down, close my eyes, I’m sure I could “meditate” for the next 14 hours.

“It’s fat,” a familiar voice speaks out from the background. It takes me a second, but I recognize it.

Perhaps, I say.

“What will you do?” Third person me asks.

I stare at the computer screen for a few seconds, and move my gaze across the balcony on the left. My eyes feel like they are sinking into an old plush sofa. Beside the water, the road is dimly lit with a few drops of streetlight. The AirBnB is right by the seaside, so I can still make out the waves. They sound closer than they look.

*It’s fat,* I repeat to myself. Fat from laziness, fat from inactivity. To be fair, certainly less than before. But fat, nonetheless.

I’ve definitely gotten a bit fatter again recently, pardon me. Uneconomical visits to gelaterias and bakeries. Daily prosciutto and pasta. Probably not very healthy, but I guess everyone has their vices.

To be honest, I don’t know if I’ll ever truly be able to cut all of it. True fatlessness. What does that look like?

Or is some fat actually okay? If that’s the case, it would be nice if someone could tell me how much is extra, and how much is needed. Some kind of point of reference. But, perhaps that’s a subjective thing too. Finding the boundary between good and bad fats is a personal decision. Cutting bad fats requires discipline, and choosing good fats requires style. At any rate, how do you find that balance, in the pursuit of truth?

In these moments, I often think about my teacher from the retreat, and the quaint afternoons on the patch of grass under the tree. I can already hear in my head, what kind of answer he’d tell me.

On the night of Day 5, I had an intense dream. Perhaps intense isn’t the right word; looking back, the contents may seem that way, but the dream itself felt gentle, as if it were cruising across a conveyor walkway at the airport.

In the dream, I was running through an office building. Not a particular office building. It didn’t have a very luxurious interior, nor any defining characteristics. The type of building you’d walk past everyday for years and not notice if it had been swapped out for something else. The only noticeable quality, if any, was a quiet sound of waves from somewhere far away.

What or who I was running from, I wasn’t quite sure. All I knew is that right then, I should be running. But the corridors and hallways were short enough that I could never really pick up speed. To keep going, I had to move from one hallway to the next. From that hallway, to another.

Come to think of it, none of the hallways had any characteristics either. A few doors, but they were always closed. And never did I have the thought that I should open any; they didn’t seem like doors that knew how to open, anyway. As if they were just pieces of furniture, decoration. It was strange, I thought, to be decorating any of these hallways. They all looked the same after all.

Not thinking too much of it (not that you think much in dreams — sometimes you do), I just ran through each hallway, with the same unchanging running form, pace, through each straight and corner. A corner after every straight. A straight after every corner. As if I was just performing some kind of perfunctory action. It could’ve been standing, or it could’ve been walking, I’m sure I would’ve felt the same way. Only in this office building, I was to be running. The hallways just kept moving past, between every corner, every straight. And the gentle sound of waves continued to float in the background.

At one point, I found myself at a longer corridor, the only one so far that had differed in any noticeable way. On the right side of the wall, a door opened in the middle. I couldn’t see what the room looked like; the lights were turned off.

On the other side, the wall lined entirely with glass windows. No blinds or covers; the windows all faced in towards an inner space of the building, something that looked like a large indoor wave pool, far below. Perhaps the sounds were coming from there. Above the middle window, a handle dangled behind the glass. The same kind of handle that might be found hanging on a train, or on a playground zipline.

When I reached this spot, the notion suddenly came to me: whatever, or whomever, I was running from, was about to finally appear. In the same instant, I noticed up ahead, there were no more straights, no more corners. I looked left to the handle behind the glass, then to the open door along the right, and back to the handle. And before I could realize, the sound of waves had crept up right beside me, louder and louder, clearer and clearer, as if at any moment, they would rise over my ears and wash all the way through.
