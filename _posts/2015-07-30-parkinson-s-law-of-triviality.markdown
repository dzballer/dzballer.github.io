  *No no, I don’t have Parkinson’s… well not yet at least.*

I read a lot as a kid, so I guess that went hand in hand with the other half. I’ve always liked to write. I’m not going to say it’s my passion, but my brain likes to think a lot; it feels good to put those thoughts on paper.

For as long as I can remember, I have always been doing some sort of writing. Although I haven’t published anything or written some five-digit word treatise, I have written some Beyblade fanfics so I mean I’m a pretty big deal.

Over the years, I’ve accumulated a ton of random stuff. The good, the bad, the stinky, the poopy; however you want to describe my work, it exists. While it’d be nice to get it into some central repository, a lot of my docs are locked away on a computer that’s still running Windows ‘98. Well, not really running.

Anyways, during the semester, I had been writing at night to relieve my stress, and thought about sharing my ideas on a blog. At the same time, I wanted to build a portfolio and display it on a personal website. Why not kill two cow’s with one stone? Wait what?

Instead of actually building the website, I ended up spending my time debating whether to use my own site or a blogging site. Each month would be a new journey to find the reasons why I should do either. Okay, each month ended up to be a new journey to find the reasons why I *shouldn’t* do either.

So I didn’t.

When I just started my summer job, many of the logistics had yet been sorted out and my set-up process included lots of waiting, and waiting I did. In the meantime, I filled up my hours by lurking on Quora, scanning news articles, and learning about new things.

Ironically, I read up a lot on workplace productivity and how you should improve focus by *impulse doing*. If you have a task that comes up, then *just do it*. It makes a lot of sense since you don’t give time for the dilatory worrying to catch up to you. If you want to get things done, this is the way to get things done.

I’d begin to notice that whenever I heard about someone’s goals, there would always be some kind of secondary obstacle they could not get over. I would see these posts, mentally throw my hands and shout, *Who Cares???* Yes, with **three** question marks.

Slowly but surely, my personal philosophy began to contour.

I realized how important it was to stay focused towards the big picture and not get distracted by the small details. What’s the point in implementing a trivial feature if the goal is to set up the infrastructure? What’s the point in crafting the pillars when you need to think of your thesis? What’s the point in worrying about which platform to use when all you really want to do is write?!

Sure, it might be important to be mindful of more low-level details, but if they’re impeding the process to reach your goal, then drop them! A man should not care what toilet he poops in; what’s important is that he poops!

I guess my toilet’s going to be Medium. Hello World!
