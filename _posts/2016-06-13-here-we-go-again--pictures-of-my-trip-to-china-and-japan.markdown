I’m itching.

It’s come and gone but it’s finally time to scratch it and start writing.

The past few months seem to be just an interval of blank space. When you’re MIA for half a year, there’s going to be some rust in the right side of your brain, not to mention a heap of explaining to do.

I’m the type of person that too often goes too fast too soon; the type of guy to eat two chips and then wake up with my hand in my 3rd bag of Cheeto’s.

But the good thing is, I finally recognize it. So as much as I *really really* want to, it’s probably not the best idea to write a eleventy-million word blog post and stuff my entire closet in my backpack.

Though I guess it depends. How big is the closet?

I just spent an hour going through all my pictures to see what the hell I actually did this year and here’s the answer:

It’s pretty fucking big!

So instead of boring you and writing a summary of the last 7 months, let’s keep a focused frame — one story, one thought, one post at a time.

I’m a new man.

Okay not really — it takes some time to get rid of old habits. So fasten your seatbelt… or loosen it… be prepared for this huge dump I’m about to release.

I can promise my next posts will not give you carpal tunnel from scrolling down a million pages.

Here are some highlights of my little adventures (since November 2015):

(Medium’s Bootstrapping makes the picture sizes huge if you don’t want to have a big ass headache by the end of this post, shrink the width of your window.)

Anyways, I have a buttload of pictures and an even bigger buttload of thoughts and stories, so I’ll try to make things more modular and as always, interesting.
