  It’s 1 AM; I just ate a Whopper and ten chicken nuggets.

No ragrets.

But as my PNS starts to slow down my heart rate and release a multitude of endorphins, I’m beginning to feel a little sluggish.

I’m beginning to feel lazy.

If you look at it from a biological perspective, it becomes intuitive that we need a “feed and breed” body state to process and prepare for rest. The Yin and Yang of our autonomic nervous system exist to maintain homeostasis — to maintain balance.

At the same time, humans have long evolved to be so-called “intelligent beings” with greater desires and attributes than simple animalistic instincts.

But we still get lazy. Everyone does.

The problem is that there is **good** lazy — and then there is **bad** lazy.

Good laziness is when you don’t want to expend unnecessary effort, so in turn you find efficient means of completing things in order to avoid dilatory work.

However, like our nervous system, the world is maintained with a balance. Laziness is no exception.

Bad laziness is what we are all afraid — and many times victim — of. It is the laziness that our parents are talking about when they yell at us to stop eating Cheetos and to turn off the TV. It is the laziness that my high school math teacher warned me would result in getting pooped on by my differential equations unit exam (yes, I did in fact receive a toilet full). It is the laziness that addicts us to comfort and holds us back from accomplishment.

Good laziness is that time you photocopied the formula sheet from the textbook instead of making your own so you could spend more time productively studying for your open book math test. Bad laziness is when you decided to watch two episodes of Breaking Bad because you saved time making the formula sheet anyways.

The great thing about laziness is that you can easily distinguish between the good and the bad. The only step you have to take is simply be aware of it.

Take writing for example. Many people ramble on, paragraph after paragraph, reiterating the same aphorisms over and over again (I may be the biggest perpetrator of this), but most times, these long treatise-like explanations are much more effectively explained in a concise and easy-to-read manner. Of course, there are times where being thorough is necessary, but if you don’t need to, why overcomplicate things?

I was just about to go into why the Eisenhower Matrix is a great tool for understanding laziness and how it affects our productivity, but then I realized I could achieve an even better effect by leaving it out instead! We often see “10 Secrets that will Boost Your Productivity by 100000%!!” pop up on our Facebook news feeds, but many times we don’t realize that the best productivity hacks are those that require no secret, no trick, just awareness.

Man, that was a really good Whopper.
